                        I learned this the harder way...one where you have to make the mistake several times before its engrained in you out of frustration. Beyond bringing an eraser to your next mock up sketch, the core of this statement means that you simply do not deploy until you've talked to enough humans, enough times to validate your assumptions. 
<br><br>
                        And the best part? Talking to humans will make you an empath. Despite businesses taking interest in the philosophy for its potential profitable returns, I believe design thinking is at its core an inherently human focus. It naturally makes any problem solver into a true empath because it's unapologetically humble in admitting that it doesn't know the solution and willingly open to changing the problem statement should the ebb and flow of divergent, convergent, and iterative cycles prove it.
<br><br> 
There is something genuine and authentic in this approach, and I think it's what makes the ux profession so wonderful; there's no better way to improve a user's experience than to humanize it.

                <p class="descriptors">if you needed to bounce ideas, you'd call me.</p>

                  <p class="copy">But a knack for creative ideas doesn't lead to a fruitful career. At least, not for a second generation immigrant taught to value job security above all else; I owed it to my parents to find a "safe career" and idea-generator simply wasn't one. 
                      <br><br>
                    I took the road most travelled by and unsurprisingly, it made me miserable for years. 
                    But everyone else seemed to be succeeding? I reasoned, I simply wasn't studying hard enough. In hindsight, I realized: 
                    <br><br>
                    (1) I was my best in new and challenging environments; on the road less travelled. 
                    <br>
                    (2) I did my best when I focused on my strengths; in understanding people. 
                    <br><br>
                    The restaurant I worked at after university had illegible breakfast menus. I could fix that ergo starting<a href="https://betterwithtea.com">my own graphic design shop.</a> 
                    <br><br>
                    The organization I volunteered for during university needed support in leadership, and I had a vision. Which lead me to Switzerland working in marketing and design for an<a href="https://aiesec.org">international youth-run nonprofit organization.</a>
                    <br><br>
                    A growing educational travel company needed new ideas in its marketing campaigns, and I had a few. The kinds that helped bring the largest group of Canadian 
                    students to<a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/04/09/solemn-ceremony-commemorates-100th-anniversary-of-pivotal-vimy-ridge-battle.html">a historical event in France.</a>
                    <br><br>
                   It dawned on me that a career in ux design encompassed all these seemingly disjointed qualities and skills. Creativity through design, resilience through failure, and the ability to find solutions that make the most positive impact on the people that need it. And of course, the ability to bounce ideas with you.
